### CPSC 120

Lab 7
Lab 4 was one of my favorite labs because I learned how to use the amke command to build nd test my projects, the make command was a big part of this Lab and it was exciting learning how to use it.

Lab8 8
Lab 8 was very fun to do because it thought me how to use nested loops to print patterns, It was very challenging for me but in the end I learned a lot and I am  happy that I know how to use them now.

lab 7
I liked lab 7 because it was very interesting how to learn how to make the comptuer know when you are over 21. This lab made me fall in love with this type of work.
